CATEGORIE DE MESSAGES:
TRANS : NACE
the thing that links a programme to a form, 
so when we execute a facture it knows what program to execute (instead of executing it from a se38)
any facture/form needs a categorie de message to be executed 
Trans: nace => conditions pilotage messages
If you have the the categorie de message, click on positionner and paste CM, and execute, it will show the program and the form related to that CM


DEBUG A SMARTFORM :
TRANS : SMARTFORMS
i have the smart form's name, i executed, get the function module and open it,
you get a program with a global init, double click on it
you get the program with the form's routine and logic, you can debug there


TRANS : sost => to visualize emails



FIND A STRING IN CODE (could be name of a form, function module...)
IF CAN BE A PROGRAM OR A FM /
TRANS : code_scanner => if it s an MF 
	package z_dev
	chaine : string that we want  
TRANS : se38 => if its a prog 
	se38 => write the string in prog => utilitaire - rech in source code 



TRANS: SM50 
is used to monitor and manage work processes. In the work process overview, you can:
